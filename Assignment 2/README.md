# Python Programs Menu

This project provides a menu-driven Python program (`programs.py`) that demonstrates solutions to a variety of common programming problems, including number theory, string manipulation, and algorithmic tasks. Each menu option corresponds to a specific function, and the program is interactive and beginner-friendly.

## Features
- Factorization, primality, perfect/Armstrong numbers, and palindrome checks
- String operations: frequency, vowels, anagrams, pangrams, and more
- Factorial and Fibonacci (recursive and iterative, with timing)
- Prime number generation (including Sieve of Eratosthenes)
- Password strength checking
- Word and character frequency analysis
- User-friendly menu with timing for computationally intensive options

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

No external dependencies are required beyond the Python standard library.

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python programs.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen menu prompts. Enter the number for the desired operation and provide any required input.

## Menu Options
1. Print all the factors of a given number
2. Print if the two given strings are equal or unequal
3. Print the frequency of the given character in the given string
4. Print the number of vowels in the given string
5. Print all the numbers divisible by a given number in the range
6. Find the factorial of a number with recursion (timed)
7. Find the factorial of a number without recursion (timed)
8. Display the Fibonacci series with recursion (timed)
9. Display the Fibonacci series without recursion (timed)
10. Print “Welcome” if your name is present in the list and “See you next time” if not
11. Find if the given number is a prime (timed)
12. Print the list of prime numbers in the given range (timed)
13. Find if the given number is a perfect number
14. Print the list of perfect numbers in the given range
15. Find if the given number is a palindrome number
16. Find if the given sentence is a pangram
17. Find if the two given strings are anagrams of each other
18. Print the frequency of each character in the given string
19. Find if the given number is an Armstrong number
20. Print all the Armstrong numbers in the given range
21. Print all the primes in the given range using Sieve of Eratosthenes (timed)
22. Improve the timing of the prime number printing program (timed, uses fastest logic)
23. Find the frequency of the words in the given sentence
24. Reverse each word separately in the given sentence
25. Check if the password is strong (capital, number, small, special)
26. Convert the given string to a number (atoi)
27. Exit

## Notes
- For options involving timing, the time taken to compute the result is displayed.
- After each operation, press Enter to return to the menu.
- The program handles invalid input gracefully and can be interrupted with Ctrl+C.
